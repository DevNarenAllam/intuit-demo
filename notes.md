# Relaibality Patterns

| **Pattern**                  | **Summary**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ambassador                   | Encapsulates and manages network communications by offloading cross-cutting tasks related to network communication. Helper services initiate communication on behalf of the client, adding reliability patterns to network communication, such as retry or buffering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Backends for Frontends       | Individualizes the service layer by creating separate services exclusive to a specific frontend interface, allowing malfunctions in one service layer to not affect another clientâ€™s access. Prioritizes reliability efforts based on expected client access patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bulkhead                     | Introduces segmentation between components to isolate the impact of malfunctions, containing faults to only the affected bulkhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Cache-Aside                  | Optimizes access to frequently read data with an on-demand cache, creating data replication. If the origin data store becomes unavailable, the cache can preserve access to frequently accessed data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Circuit Breaker              | Prevents continuous requests to malfunctioning dependencies, avoiding overloads. Circuit breakers can trigger graceful degradation and are often coupled with automatic recovery, supporting both self-preservation and self-healing.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Claim Check                  | Separates data from the messaging flow, increasing reliability by storing data separately from the message. This pattern also supports message queue recovery after a disaster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Compensating Transaction     | Provides a mechanism to recover from failures by reversing actions previously applied. Compensation actions include rolling back data changes, releasing locks, or applying system behaviors to reverse actions, addressing malfunctions in critical paths.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Competing Consumers          | Applies distributed, concurrent processing for efficient queue handling, enabling redundancy so that other consumers can continue processing messages if an instance fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Event Sourcing               | Treats state changes as a series of events stored in an immutable log, providing a reliable history of changes, especially in complex processes. This enables state reconstruction for recovery purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Federated Identity           | Delegates user management and authentication to an external identity provider with a high SLA. Offloads reliability for these components to the provider, which simplifies disaster recovery plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Gateway Aggregation          | Simplifies client interactions by aggregating multiple backend service calls into one request, centralizing transient fault handling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Gateway Offloading           | Offloads request processing to a gateway, reducing backend complexity by using reliable platform-provided features for security and routing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Gateway Routing              | Routes requests to different backend systems based on request intents, logic, and backend availability, allowing routing only to healthy nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Geode                        | Deploys systems in active-active mode across multiple geographies using data replication, allowing clients to connect to any instance and helping workloads withstand regional outages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Health Endpoint Monitoring    | Provides a health/status endpoint for monitoring, alerting, and self-healing of workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ambassador            | Encapsulates and manages network communications by offloading cross-cutting tasks related to network communication. Helper services initiate communication on behalf of the client, providing a mediation point to enhance security on network communications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Backends for Frontends| Individualizes the service layer by creating separate services exclusive to a specific frontend interface. This separation allows tailored security and authorization in the service layer for each client, potentially reducing the surface area of an API and limiting lateral movement among backends with different capabilities.                                                                                                       |
| Bulkhead              | Introduces segmentation between components to isolate the impact of malfunctions, allowing containment of security incidents to the compromised bulkhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Claim Check           | Separates data from the messaging flow, enabling secure retrieval of data related to a message from a separate data store. This setup keeps sensitive data out of message bodies and allows stricter authorization, restricting data visibility from ancillary services.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Federated Identity    | Delegates user management and authentication to an external identity provider, offering evolved identity-based threat detection and prevention. External identity providers use interoperable authentication protocols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Gatekeeper            | Offloads security and access control enforcement to a gateway before forwarding requests to a backend. This centralization enables the use of security features like web application firewalls, DDoS protection, bot detection, and authorization checks.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Gateway Aggregation   | Simplifies client interactions by aggregating calls to multiple backend services into a single request, reducing client touchpoints and public surface area. Aggregated backends can remain network-isolated from clients.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Gateway Offloading    | Offloads request processing to a gateway before forwarding to a backend, allowing centralized security features like web application firewalls and TLS connections, enhancing platform security.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Publisher/Subscriber  | Decouples components by replacing direct client-to-service communication with an intermediary message broker or event bus, introducing a security boundary and enabling network isolation of queue subscribers from the publisher.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Quarantine            | Ensures external assets meet quality standards before authorization for use within the workload. Validation occurs in a segmented environment as a first security check in the secure development lifecycle (SDL).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Sidecar               | Extends an application by encapsulating nonprimary tasks in a companion process alongside the main application, reducing the surface area of sensitive processes and adding cross-cutting security controls to components not natively designed with those capabilities.                                                                                                                                |
| Throttling            | Imposes limits on incoming request rates to prevent resource exhaustion from automated abuse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Valet Key             | Grants restricted access to resources without using a proxy, allowing direct access with auditable transactions. Access is limited in scope and duration, simplifying revocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claim Check                  | Separates data from the messaging flow, allowing separate retrieval of data related to a message. Reducing message size might enable cheaper messaging solutions, as messaging systems often impose limits on message size, with increased limits as a premium feature.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Competing Consumers          | Applies distributed and concurrent processing to handle items in a queue efficiently. This pattern can optimize costs by scaling based on queue depth, down to zero when the queue is empty, and by limiting the maximum number of concurrent consumer instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Compute Resource Consolidation| Optimizes compute resources by increasing density through consolidation of multiple applications or workload components on shared infrastructure, maximizing utilization and avoiding unused provisioned capacity. Container orchestrators are a common example of this pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Gateway Offloading           | Offloads request processing to a gateway before forwarding to a backend, redirecting costs from per-node resource expenditures to the gateway. Centralized processing often results in lower costs than distributed processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Messaging Bridge             | Provides an intermediary for communication between incompatible messaging systems, allowing interoperability across systems that use different messaging or eventing technologies. This approach can extend the life of an existing system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Publisher/Subscriber         | Decouples components by replacing direct client-to-service communication with communication via a message broker or event bus, enabling an event-driven architecture. This design can reduce costs with consumption-based billing by avoiding overprovisioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Queue-Based Load Leveling    | Buffers incoming requests in a queue, allowing the processor to handle them at a controlled rate, reducing the need to overprovision resources for peak loads by decoupling load processing from request intake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Sharding                     | Directs load to specific logical destinations, often using multiple instances of less expensive compute or storage resources rather than a single more expensive one, providing potential cost savings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Static Content Hosting       | Optimizes delivery of static content by using a static hosting platform, which is generally more cost-effective than dynamic application hosts that run business logic. Using an application platform to deliver static content can be inefficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Strangler Fig                | Allows systematic replacement of system components with new ones during migration or modernization, maximizing the value of current investments while enabling high-ROI replacements before lower-ROI ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Throttling                   | Imposes limits on the rate or throughput of incoming requests, which can inform cost modeling and may be tied directly to the business model. It also defines clear upper bounds on utilization, useful for resource sizing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Valet Key                    | Grants restricted access to a resource directly, without an intermediary. This approach reduces proxy-related processing and is beneficial when client requests are frequent or large, especially if the proxy does not add value to the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Anti-Corruption Layer        | Protects new system components from legacy systems' behavior by adding a mediator layer between legacy and new components. This ensures new component designs remain unaffected by legacy implementations with different data models or business rules. Useful in gradual migrations, it reduces technical debt while still supporting existing components.                                                                                                      |
| Choreography                 | Coordinates the behavior of autonomous distributed components through decentralized, event-driven communication. This is helpful for workloads where services are updated or replaced frequently, allowing modifications with minimal impact on the overall system.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Compute Resource Consolidation| Optimizes compute resources by consolidating multiple applications or workload components on shared infrastructure, creating a more homogenous compute platform. This consolidation simplifies management, reduces disparate operational approaches, and minimizes tooling requirements.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Deployment Stamps            | Provides a way to release a specific version of an application and its infrastructure as a controlled deployment unit, supporting concurrent deployments of different versions. This aligns with immutable infrastructure goals, enabling advanced deployment models and safer deployment practices.                                                                                                                                                           |
| External Configuration Store  | Stores configuration outside the application, supporting dynamic updates without redeployment. This allows environment-specific configurations and versioning, and is also useful for managing feature flags to enable safe deployments.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Gateway Aggregation          | Simplifies client interactions by aggregating calls to multiple backend services in a single request. This approach allows backend logic to evolve independently, enabling changes to service implementations or data sources without altering client touchpoints.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Gateway Offloading           | Offloads request processing to a gateway, centralizing management of offloaded functionality. This reduces the need for configuration upkeep across multiple nodes, consolidating it at a single point.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Gateway Routing              | Routes network requests to different backend systems based on request intents, business logic, and backend availability. This decouples requests from backends, enabling backends to support advanced deployment models, platform transitions, and unified management for DNS and encryption in transit.                                                                                                             |
| Health Endpoint Monitoring    | Provides a system health monitoring endpoint, which helps standardize health checks across a workload, facilitating issue triage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Messaging Bridge             | Acts as an intermediary to enable communication between incompatible messaging systems, allowing flexibility in transitioning messaging technology or managing diverse external dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Publisher/Subscriber         | Decouples architecture components by replacing direct communication with an intermediate message broker or event bus. This allows independent changes to the publisher or subscriber without requiring coordination between them.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Quarantine                   | Ensures external assets meet quality standards before authorization for workload use, incorporating automated checks as part of the software development lifecycle and safe deployment practices (SDP).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Sidecar                      | Extends application functionality by encapsulating secondary tasks in a companion process alongside the main application. This allows flexible tool integration for observability, enabling sidecar functionality to evolve independently of the application's lifecycle.                                                                                                                                              |
| Strangler Fig                | Systematically replaces old components with new ones during migration or modernization, enabling continuous improvement with incremental changes rather than large, riskier modifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Asynchronous Request-Reply        | Improves responsiveness and scalability by decoupling request and reply phases for interactions that donâ€™t need immediate answers. Maximizes concurrency on the server side, allowing work to be scheduled as capacity allows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Backends for Frontends            | Creates separate services exclusive to specific frontend interfaces, optimizing performance based on each clientâ€™s constraints and functionality. This individualized service layer allows optimizations that arenâ€™t possible with a shared service layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
